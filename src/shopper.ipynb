    "# Shopper Class\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an individual lab. Using a jupyter notebook (best done on Google\n",
    "Colab) write the python statement to define a Shopper class. The test\n",
    "harness is provided to you by the instructor as well as the resulting\n",
    "output given.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description of the Shopper Class\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class variable\n",
    "\n",
    "There are six class variables (i.e., variables that are shared by all\n",
    "objects of this class)\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\_\\_prices**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a python dict that contains the grocery items as well as their\n",
    "unit price. This is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "{ 'apple': 1.99, 'bread': 2.19, 'milk': 4.96, 'pepper': 1.25 }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\_\\_sale_items**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a list that contains all the items that are on sale in this\n",
    "period. A discount of 15% is applied to the price of each item in this\n",
    "collection. This is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "'pepper banana'.split()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Four other class variable that are define as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "__credit_threshold = 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When the total cost of a purchase exceeds this amount then a discount is\n",
    "applied to the cost.\n",

    "```\n",

    "### Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor takes two argument that represents the name of the\n",
    "shopper and the amount of money she has. It assigns the argument to\n",
    "appropriate instance variable. It also creates an empty list to store\n",
    "the purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each purchase is a single tuple comprising of the name of the item and\n",
    "the price actually paid for the item.\n",

    "### Instance property\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a single instance property that returns the name of this\n",
    "shopper.\n",

    "### Class method\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two class methods that returns the price list and the sales\n",
    "items.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance method\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two instance method:\n",
    "\n",
    "**purchase**\n",
    "\n",
    "This method takes a list of items to be purchase. It calculates the\n",
    "total price of the purchase by processing each item in the argument as\n",
    "show below:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The price of an item is obtained from the price list. If it is not\n",
    "> found in the price list then the default price is used. *\\[How to\n",
    "> determine if an item in not in the dict\\]*\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If the item is in the sales list a discount is applied to the price\n",

    "> *\\[How to create a tuple with name and price and how to add the tuple\n",
    "> to the list\\]*\n",
    ">\n",
    "> When all the items are processed, if the final cost is over the credit\n",
    "> threshold, then a discount is applied to this amount and then\n",
    "> subtracted from the amount of money this object has left over.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\_\\_str\\_\\_**\n",
    "\n",
    "This method returns a string representing this object with all its\n",
    "purchases.\n",

    "## How to do this assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above description and test harness and the result output below,\n",
    "try to deduce the definition of the Shopper class. Code this class in a\n",
    "jupyter notebook and copy the test harness to a cell below. Execute the\n",
    "notebook and ensure that the output matches EXACTLY with the output on\n",
    "the following page.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must use python f-strings for your output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the code is so simple no code documentation is required, however\n",
    "you must put your name and the current date somewhere at the top of your\n",
    "code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to submit this assignment\n",
